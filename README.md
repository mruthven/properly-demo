# Demo for Properly

Currently, a simple CRUD API based on the Serverless Framework Node Express API Template
 * Added a general SCAN api, as well as responding to delete to existing Users data
 * Created a Properties table, with simple post and get route that returns active properties

Next steps:
 * adjust users table to support authentication of Properties routes
 * adjust properties schema to support transaction history (GSI or another table?)
 * finish off put & delete routes for Properties
 * create a new lambda/handler for Properties routes
